# Point-of-Gaze estimation in the wild
## A robust approach for PoG tailored for end users

## Abstract 

In a challenging project, I successfully developed a real-time Point of Gaze (PoG) estimation model
for analyzing ad viewership on social media. My leadership as a tech lead and active engagement as an 
individual contributor were pivotal in orchestrating a novel, multi-disciplinary approach encompassing 
data collection, validation, and model construction using RGB images in desktop settings. Key actions 
included managing large-scale data collection via Amazon Mechanical Turk, creating efficient data processing
pipelines, and developing a robust CNN model enhanced with pre-trained architectures. We significantly mitigated 
over-fitting and optimized performance using custom loss functions, achieving an impressive error margin.

This endeavor not only achieved its direct objectives but also propelled the company into new markets such as the UK, 
Ireland, and Twitch streaming platforms, generating substantial contracts, with similar subsequent agreements. 
Our project delivered high customer satisfaction, especially in ROI, solidifying the company's market standing and 
showcasing our team's capabilities in meeting tight deadlines, strategic planning, and fostering collaboration under 
pressure. This project underlines the importance of clear communication, leadership, and adaptability in dynamic 
project environments, setting a benchmark for future initiatives.
