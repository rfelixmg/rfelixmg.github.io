# Geospatial Visual Question Answering

## Abstract 

While querying of structured geospatial data such as Google Maps has become commonplace, 
there remains a wealth of unstructured information in overhead imagery that is largely 
inaccessible to users. This information can be made accessible using machine learning for
Visual Question Answering (VQA) about remote sensing imagery. We propose a novel method 
for Earth observation based on answering natural language questions about satellite images
that uses cross-modal attention between image objects and text. The image is encoded with
an object-centric feature space, with self-attention between objects, and the question is 
encoded with a language transformer network. The image and question representations are 
fed to a cross-modal transformer network that uses cross-attention between the image and 
text modalities to generate the answer. Our method is applied to the RSVQA remote sensing 
dataset and achieves a significant accuracy increase over the previous benchmark.
