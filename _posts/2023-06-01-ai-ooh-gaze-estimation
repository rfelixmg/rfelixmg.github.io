# Gaze orientation in Un-Structured environments
## A robust Gaze orientation approach for solving attention estimation on Out-of-Home advertisement


## Abstract

In response to the need for advanced metrics in out-of-home advertising, we developed a pioneering hardware
and software solution capable of identifying pedestrian traffic and gaze duration on large billboards in
near real-time. As the tech lead and a hands-on contributor, I played a crucial role in scoping project deliverables,
conducting cost analyses, and leading the R&D efforts for deploying cutting-edge machine learning algorithms,
such as object detection and innovating a 3D gaze estimation technique.

Our solution leveraged AWS for efficient 4K data processing and introduced cost-effective hardware, significantly
improving the accuracy and efficiency of pedestrian count and gaze measurement. This project not only established
our company as a leader in billboard metrics but also achieved outstanding customer satisfaction and a significant
return on investment.

Key technical achievements included achieving over 90% precision and recall in object detection, a novel benchmark
in gaze estimation accuracy, and optimizing processing times to achieve near real-time data handling on cost-effective
 cloud infrastructure. The business impact was profound, with substantial revenue generation, strategic market
 positioning, and demonstrable scalability and reproducibility of the solution across vendors.

Looking forward, we aim to explore more cost-effective processing alternatives and enhance data quality through
advanced camera configurations, ensuring the project's adaptability and continued success in evolving market
conditions.
