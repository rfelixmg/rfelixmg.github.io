I am Rafa, currently I joined Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV) as a Ph.D. candidate. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Gustavo Carneiro](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~carneiro/) and co-supervision of [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/) at [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). My research project aims to bring contributions to the fields of generalized zero-shot learning using generative models.
