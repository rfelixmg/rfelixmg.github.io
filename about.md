Hello, I am Rafa.

I am currently a Research Fellow at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML). Recently, I have been developing application on Generalised Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL), Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Visual Question Answering (VQA). 
My research interests include deep learning combining vision and language for explainable artifficial intelligence.

I completed my PhD studies at The University of Adelaide (UoA), Australia, under the supervision of [Prof. Gustavo Carneiro](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~carneiro/), 
[Dr. Michele Sasdelli](www.roboticvision.org/rv_person/michele-mike-sasdelli/), and [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/), with a prestigious scholarship from Australian Research Council. Previously, I have industry experience. In my first position, I developed machine learning applications for acquiring data from online sources. Secondly, I was a data scientist at a Motorola outsource company working on machine learning for mobile platforms.  I received my M.Sc. from Universidade Mackenzie, where I worked with [Prof. L. de Castro](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=peaQM0EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), with a prestigious scholarship from the federal agency *CAPES*. In my master degree, I focused on Neural Networks and their use for image processing on scanned documents, and their intersection with natural language processing. Over the course of my M.Sc., I worked on parallel projects using machine learning to develop applications for scanned documents.

On my free time, I enjoy tackling quick projects like programming affordable drones, and small robots.
