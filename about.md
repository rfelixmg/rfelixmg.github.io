Hello, I am Rafa.

Currently, I am PhD Research student at Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV) as a Ph.D. candidate. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Gustavo Carneiro](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~carneiro/) and co-supervision of [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/) at [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). My research project aims to bring contributions to the fields of generalized zero-shot learning, zero-shot learning and open-set recognition. Before, I received M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie (Brazil – 2015), and B.Sc. on Information Systems, Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros (Brazil – 2011).

Keywords: Zero-Shot Learning, Deep Learning, Gaussian processes, convolutional neural networks, Uncertainty Estimation, Fooling Neural Nets.
