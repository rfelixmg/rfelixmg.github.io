Hi there, I am Rafa.

I am a Brazilian-Australian computer scientist with a rich background in machine learning, 
specializing in computer vision and natural language processing. Since moving to Australia 
in 2016 to complete my PhD, I've made significant contributions to the field, particularly 
in the multi-modal integration of vision and language. My work has been recognized at 
prestigious academic conferences, highlighting my commitment to pushing the boundaries of ML research.

In the industry, I've taken on roles as a tech lead and individual contributor, where I've led ML 
roadmap initiatives and collaborated closely with C-Suite and cross-functional teams. My leadership 
helped refine and implement effective AI/ML strategies. Additionally, my hands-on work in R&D has 
utilized cutting-edge technologies such as LLMs, CNNs, Transformer Networks, and GANs, significantly advancing 
the capabilities of data-driven products through sophisticated ML workflows. My passion for mentoring 
has also enabled me to support my team in deepening their technical expertise, fostering a culture of 
continuous learning and innovation.

Keywords: large-language models, zero-shot learning, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, generative models, multi-modality,
visual question answering.
